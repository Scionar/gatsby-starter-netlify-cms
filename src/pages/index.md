title: Nudging Pixels
description: >
  If you think Alvar Aalto, Iittala and Marimekko are what Finnish design is
  about, you’re mistaken. Hosts Elina Korpela and Maya Pillai, designers at
  Houston Inc., have taken it upon themselves to tell you that there is more on
  offer. They talk to the designers and developers behind some of the most
  exciting digital products and trends coming out of Finland. And give you a
  glimpse of what’s beyond this pixel pushing life. Nudging Pixels is an
  original podcast by Houston Inc. New episodes are out on the second Friday of
  every month.
