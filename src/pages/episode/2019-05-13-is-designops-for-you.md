  DesignOps helps companies invest in design by operationalizing their workflow,
  hiring, alignment between teams, and more so that designers are able to focus
  on design work and let someone else take control of the rest. But who really
  needs DesignOps? Whenâ€™s the right time to start thinking about it, and how
  does one even get started? We chat with Angelos Arnis, Design Operations at
  Elisa and Sonja Krogius, Lead Designer at Nordkapp, the people behind the
  DesignOps meetups in Helsinki.
